    The Demographic Analysis Panel provides the user with an overview of 
    the number and percent of subjects that correspond to many of the 
    variables in the Demographics dataset.  It looks at the frequency 
    of variables such as Race, Ethnicity, Sex, Country, Site and a derived 
    variable for Age Groups, as well as descriptive statistics of the 
    variable Age. This is done by total study population, treatment 
    arm and disposition categories.

  The Demographics Analysis Panel contains the 15 analyses. For the 
  demographic variables, the denominator for percent calculations is 
  automatically defined by the DM dataset using the actual arm (ACTARM) or 
  planned treatment arm variable (ARM), excluding cases labeled as Screen
  Failures or Not Assigned. For the demographic variables by disposition
  categories, the denominator for percent calculations is the demographic 
  variable total by arm and overall study population.
