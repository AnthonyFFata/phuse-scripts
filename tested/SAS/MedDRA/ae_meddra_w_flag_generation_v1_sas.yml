Comments: >
  The MedDRA at a Glance Analysis Panel shows the user the adverse events
  that occurred in the study according to their place in the MedDRA 
  hierarchy, using the system organ class (SOC), high-level group term 
  (HLGT), high-level term (HLT), and preferred term (PT). The user can 
  choose which two arms to compare and set thresholds which determine 
  whether the risk difference, relative risk, or negative log p-value 
  for difference in proportion between the two arms is a signal of interest. 
  The user can also sort and filter by any of the information contained in 
  the report.
