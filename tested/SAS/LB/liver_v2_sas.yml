    The Liver Lab Analysis Panel provides the User with an overview of 
	the number and percent of subjects who have predefined abnormalities 
	in lab test values for Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate 
	Aminotransferase (AST), Total Bilirubin (TB), and Alkaline Phosphatase
	(ALP). It provides the frequency of the lab test values that occur in 
	varying degrees above what is considered a normal lab value (upper limit
	of normal, ULN). It also compares maximum lab values between tests, and 
	looks at the maximum lab values by (i.e, as a function of) study day.

  The Liver Lab Analysis Panel contains the five analyses outlined below.
  Note that the denominator used for percent calculations in this analysis
  panel is based on the arm variable. This is calculated by the number of 
  subjects exposed to at least one dose of treatment per arm (either actual
  or planned depending on what exists in the data).
