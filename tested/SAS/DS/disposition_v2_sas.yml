     disposition event broken down by category and sub-category as submitted 
     by the sponsor. 
  Analysis 3: Time to Disposition Event by Arm for All Subjects
    For each disposition event in a chosen category and subcategory, provides
     a graph showing the cumulative proportion of subject disposition events 
     over time, using the study day.
  Analysis 4: Time to Disposition Event by Arm for Exposed Subjects
