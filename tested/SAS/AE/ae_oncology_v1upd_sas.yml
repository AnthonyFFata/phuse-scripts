    The AE Toxicity Analysis Panel provides the user with 
    different analyses to help understand the adverse events present 
	in the study and the frequency of their occurrence by treatment arm. 
	Statistical and frequency reports are generated to provide the user 
	with needed information.

  The AE Toxicity Analysis Panel contains the analyses as listed below. 
  Analysis 1: Toxicity Grade Summary 
  This analysis shows how many and what proportion of each arm's subjects 
  experienced any adverse event, for all toxicity grades and for toxicity 
  grades 3, 4, and 5.
  Analysis 2&3: Preferred Term Analysis by Toxicity Grade
  This analysis lists all adverse events that appeared in the study and shows
  how many and what proportion of subjects experienced each adverse event in 
  each arm, for all toxicity grades and for toxicity grades 3, 4, and 5. 
  Analysis 4&5: Two-Term MedDRA Analysis 
  This analysis lists all adverse events that appeared in the study that 
  correspond to two user-selected MedDRA levels and shows how many and what 
  proportion of subjects experienced each adverse event in the treatment arm
  and the control arm for user-selected toxicity grades.
  This analysis also gives risk differences, relative risks, odds ratios, 
  confidence limits for 95% confidence intervals for these statistics, and 
  p-values for these adverse events.
