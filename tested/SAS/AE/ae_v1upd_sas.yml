  The AE Severity Analysis Panel provides the user with different analyses 
  to help understand the adverse events present in the study and the 
  frequency of their occurrence by treatment arm. Statistical and 
  frequency reports are generated to provide the user with needed information.  
  The Adverse Event analysis panel generates three separate Excel workbooks. 
  1. Adverse Events Counts:  provides various combinations of counts and 
     percentages of most frequent adverse events and serious adverse events 
	 by treatment arm
  2. Adverse Events Relative Risk: provides a listing of the relative risk of
     adverse events between arms with their corresponding confidence intervals
  3. Adverse Events Odds Ratio: provides a listing of odds ratios of adverse 
     events between arms with their corresponding confidence intervals
