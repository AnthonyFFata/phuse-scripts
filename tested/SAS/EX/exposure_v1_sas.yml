    The Exposure Analysis Panel provides the user with an overview 
     of the treatment dosing in the Exposure Dataset. The Exposure 
     Analysis Panel details the time on drug and number of doses taken
     by treatment arm, descriptive statistics of the treatment arms, 
     the number of subjects in proposed arm compared to actual treatment,
     and dosing adjustments.

  The Exposure Analysis Panel contains the five analyses outlined below:
  Analysis 1: Percent of Subjects Left on Study Medication by Day of Study 
  Provides a chart trending the percentage of subjects remaining in the study 
  by treatment arm.
  Analysis 2: Distribution of Doses by Arm
    Provides a chart plotting the percentage of subjects by number of 
     cumulative doses received throughout the study by treatment arm.
  Analysis 3: Dose Descriptive Statistics by Arm and Boxplot of Doses
    1. Provides a table of the descriptive statistics Mean, Median, Mode, 
        Standard Deviation, Quartile 1, Quartile 3, Minimum, and Maximum for 
        the cumulative doses received by treatment arm.
    2. Provides a chart of the descriptive statistics Mean, Median, Standard 
        Deviation, Quartile 1, Quartile 3, Minimum, and Maximum for the 
        cumulative doses received by treatment arm.
  Analysis 4: Planned Arm to Actual Treatment Comparison
    Provides a table comparing the number of subjects in the planned arm 
     variable from the Demographic Dataset to the number of subjects in the 
     actual treatment variable from the Exposure Dataset.
  Analysis 5: Dose Changes During the Study
    Provides a table listing the subjects who experienced an adjustment in
     dose, the dose value and units, and study day the change occurred.
