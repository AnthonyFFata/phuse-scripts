### PDS SEND Public Dataset
This is an anonymized SEND data set that has been successfully run through the FDA validation process

The anonymized data set is for a one-month GLP rat toxicity study with recovery. It contains pool data for food consumption, as animals were group housed. The .xpt files included in the file set are `BG`, `BW`, `CL`, `CO`, `DM`, `EX`, `FW`, `LB`, `MA`, `MI`, `OM`, `PC`, `POOLDEF`, `PP`, `RELREC`, `SC`, `SE`, `SUPPMA`, `SUPPMI`, `SUPPPP`, `TA`, `TE`, `TS`, `TX`. The define.pdf and define.xml files are also included.

The data set is an example of an inter-organizational SEND data set, with multiple LIMS data sources compiled into a single, harmonized file set. The data types were provided from the following systems:

* Toxicology - Third-party toxicology system
* Clinical Pathology - Third-party system
* Pathology - PDS PathData system
* Pharmacokinetics - Watson LIMS

PDS originally published these data in a pilot electronic submission package (year 2014):
