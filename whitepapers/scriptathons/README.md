#### Background
This folder contains scripts that community volunteers created during Scriptathon events in 2013 and 2014.

#### Plans
Any community member can enhance of expand this set of scripts.

The techniques and ideas in these scripts contribute directly to the White Paper packages that the Standard Analyses development group publish.

The intention of the White Paper packages is to take the best techniques and ideas from these individual scripts as the basis for white paper packages that:
# optimize usability and maintainability
# minimize the code that requires testing and qualification

The first White Paper package is for the [White Paper on measures of Central Tendency, WPCT](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/tree/master/whitepapers/WPCT).
