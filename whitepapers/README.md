#### Contributing to our 2016 goal

The working group's **2016 goal** is to publish R and SAS scripts that unlock the standard analyses that the [White Paper on Central Tendency](http://www.phusewiki.org/wiki/images/4/48/CSS_WhitePaper_CentralTendency_v1.0.pdf) (**WPCT**) specifies.

#### Task Lists

We maintain Task Lists (to-do lists) for both:

  * [Work Group 5, overall](./TODO.md)
  * The [WPCT Standard Script Package](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/blob/master/whitepapers/WPCT/TODO.md)

See the [Central Tendency User Guide](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/blob/master/whitepapers/CentralTendency-UserGuide.md) for further details on using or contributing to this project.


#### Folder Structure

A brief description of each folder at this level:

* [**WPCT**](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/tree/master/whitepapers/WPCT)
  * Standard scripts for WPCT data displays, in SAS and R. Example outputs are in language-specific subfolders.
* [**qualification**](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/tree/master/whitepapers/qualification)
  * Test plans & test scripts for the standard scripts and the components that they use. Results and artifacts of testing are in language-specific subfolders.
* [**specifications**](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/tree/master/whitepapers/specification)
  * General formatting conventions, as well as detailed specifications for each Central Tendancy display.
* [**utilities**](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/tree/master/whitepapers/utilities)
  * SAS macros that the standard scripts use for basic (generic) discovery and manipulation tasks, which should otherwise not cause distraction from the analyses that the standard scripts conduct.
* [**scriptathon**](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/tree/master/whitepapers/scriptathon)
  * Scripts that volunteers created during PhUSE Scriptathon events through 2015, which we mine for good techniques and ideas for our standard, qualified scripts.
* [**images**](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/tree/master/whitepapers/images)
  * Images to support our github documentation. See for example our [WPCT to-do list](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/blob/master/whitepapers/WPCT/TODO.md)

**Note**: Code on this site is by definition 'under development'.
