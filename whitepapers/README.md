The working group's **2016 goal** is to publish R and SAS scripts that unlock the standard analyses that the [White Paper on Central Tendency](http://www.phusewiki.org/wiki/images/4/48/CSS_WhitePaper_CentralTendency_v1.0.pdf) (**WPCT**) specifies.

While work continues on our github folder structure, the Repository Content team is working within this folder. The structure:
* [CentralTendency-UserGuide.txt](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/blob/master/whitepapers/CentralTendency-UserGuide.txt)
  * Guidance for WPCT Script Users and Contributors
* [**WPCT**](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/tree/master/whitepapers/WPCT)
  * Standard scripts for WPCT data displays, in SAS and R. Example outputs are in language-specific subfolders.
* [**qualification**](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/tree/master/whitepapers/qualification)
  * Test plans & test scripts for the standard scripts and the components that they use. Results and artifacts of testing are in language-specific subfolders.
* [**specifications**](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/tree/master/whitepapers/specification)
  * General formatting conventions, as well as detailed specifications for each Central Tendancy display.
* [**utilities**](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/tree/master/whitepapers/utilities)
  * SAS macros that the standard scripts use for basic (generic) discovery and manipulation tasks, which should otherwise not cause distraction from the analyses that the standard scripts conduct.
* [**scriptathon**](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/tree/master/whitepapers/scriptathon)
  * Scripts that volunteers created during PhUSE Scriptathon events through 2015.

**Note**: Code on this site is by definition 'under development'.
