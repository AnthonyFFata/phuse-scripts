User Guide
0.1

* PhUSE/CSS Central Tendency data displays are described in detail in the "Central Tendency" White Paper
  . http://www.phusewiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=SS_P08_Central_Tendency_White_Paper

* Analyses as well as SAS and R implementations are based on ADaM-compliant data sets
  . Out of scope: ADaM conformance checks
  . Out of scope: analysing SDTM data

* Getting started with SAS and R scripts
  . Each data display in the Central Tendency White Paper (CTWP) has a same-name script in SAS and R
  . We refer to these as "standard" scripts - because they produce one of the standard displays enumerated in the CTWP
  . Standard R scripts require some common functions, available in github
    (here?)
  . Standard SAS scripts require some common macros, available in github 
    https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/tree/master/whitepapers/utilities
  . Scripts require that users set some parameters based on their computing environments and data
  . Scripts are organized to clearly isolate user settings and pre-processing instructions (e.g., to subset data before performing analyses)
