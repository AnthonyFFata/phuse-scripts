#### The future of Standard Scripts for Analysis and Reporting

The CS working group "Development of Standard Scripts for Analysis and Programming" have met their main goal: to establish a framework for standardizing analyses across the industry. Recent progress falls mainly in 3 areas:

1. The White Paper project have developed guidance on 9 data analysis topics, and have published 3.

2. The Infrastructure project has established a GitHub code repository.

3. The Content project have established implementation guidelines and a qualification process, and are publishing scripts that display standard measures of Central Tendency.

The focus for the 2016 CSS season is to promote adoption of these standard analyses; to coordinate review of, finalize and publish white papers; and to increase the scope, quality and usability of the corresponding R and SAS scripts. A framework for collaboration enables standard analyses, but it is just a starting point. To fully realize the vision of standard industry analyses requires expertise and resources: a commitment by stakeholders. This poster will review the vision, summarize progress to date, and outline proposals to resource further advances.
