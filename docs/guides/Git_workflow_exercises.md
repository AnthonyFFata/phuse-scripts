### GitHub Roles

[GitHub article on Repository Permission Levels](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/)

  1. phuse-or/phuse-scripts Maintainers: can change master code
  2. GitHub Contributors: can create "pull request" from their own branch, for the Maintainers to review

Relevant roles for phuse-org/phuse-scripts?
  1. Admin (admin access (what does that mean above Write access?)
  2. Developer (write access)
  3. Contributors (no write access)? [our repo teams](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/settings/collaboration) -- Owner? Admin? Is this the right setup?

#### phuse-or/phuse-scripts Setup

  * Master branch is always "production ready"
  * Therefore relatively few "Developers", who
    * have "write access", and can therefore
    * review "pull requests" and commit changes to master branch
  * There are also "Admins" who can
    * can promote engaged contributors to the "Developers" team
  * All others (contributors?) can do ... what is it? 
    * ....

#### GitHub Exercises PSch: Are we creating some 'sandbox for this? What files to we use for examples? 

  * Simple steps: Contributor? suggest a change to an UNmodified file on the master branch
    1. ? Clone the repository
    2. modify file
    3. "pull request" ... screenshots
    4. what happens then: Developer reviews the file? How does she know that there is a change to review?
    5. Open questions: when does this process end? What if the change is rejected? Does the contributor learn what happend to the suggested change? How?
  * Substantial change (takes some time)
    1. ? Create a fork (is branching only for members with "write" access??)
    2. develop modules
    3. "pull" changes from master branch
    4. resolve any conflicts
    5. "pull request" ... screenshots
    6. Now as above?
