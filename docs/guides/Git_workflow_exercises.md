### GitHub Roles

[GitHub article on Repository Permission Levels](http://help.github.com/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/)

  1. phuse-or/phuse-scripts Maintainers: can change master code
  2. GitHub Contributors: can create "pull request" from their own branch, for the Maintainers to review

Relevant roles for phuse-org/phuse-scripts?
  1. Admin (manage repository settings, NOT relevant for workshop)
  2. Maintainer (write access)
  3. Contributors (no write access)? [our repo teams](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/settings/collaboration)

#### phuse-or/phuse-scripts Setup

  * Master branch is always "production ready"
  * Therefore relatively few "Maintainers", who
    * have "write access", and can therefore
    * review "pull requests" and commit changes to master branch
  * Any GitHub member can 
    * "fork" the phuse-scripts repository
    * develop new scripts or enhance any element
    * create a "pull request", a proposal to incorporate your modifications into the phuse-scripts repository

#### GitHub Exercises PSch: Are we creating some 'sandbox for this? What files to we use for examples? 

  * Simple steps: Contributor suggests a change to an UNmodified file on the master branch
    1. Fork the repository
    2. modify file
    3. "pull request" ... screenshots
    4. what happens then: Maintainer reviews the file? How does she know that there is a change to review?
    5. Open questions: when does this process end? What if the change is rejected? Does the contributor learn what happend to the suggested change? How?
  * Substantial change (takes some time)
    1. ? Create a fork (is branching only for members with "write" access??)
    2. develop modules
    3. "pull" changes from master branch
    4. resolve any conflicts
    5. "pull request" ... screenshots
    6. Now as above?
  * Contributing without GitHub access
