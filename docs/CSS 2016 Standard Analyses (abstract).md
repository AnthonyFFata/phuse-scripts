#### - Roadmap for Standard Scripts for Analysis and Reporting

The Standard Scripts for Analysis and Reporting CSS working group have met their main goal: to establish a platform for the collaborative development of program code. Recent progress falls mainly in areas:

1. The White Paper project have developed guidance on 9 topics, and have published 3.

2. The infrastructure project has established a GitHub code repository.

3. The content project have established development guidelines, qualification processes, and are publishing scripts that display standard measures of Central Tendency

The focus for the 2016 CSS season is to promote adoption of the standard analyses, and to improve quality and usability of the corresponding R and SAS scripts. In order to make it easy for the industry, academia and regulatory to adopt and use the repository, a framework has to be set up, and a toolkit has to be built based on the repository. This pivotal effort requires more dedicated resources and a commitment by the stakeholders. This poster will show the roadmap of how we will further achieve this goal.
