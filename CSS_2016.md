## CSS 2016 Task List

In preparation for [CSS 2016](http://www.phuse.eu/annual-conference.aspx), **Working Group 5, Standard Analyses**, highlight a few tasks that we will initiate or complete during our annual symposium.

Our two main subteams are: 
  1. White Papers (define analyses), and 
  2. Standard Scripts (implement analyses)

#### Standard Analyses (White Papers)

Please see this [status of current white papers](http://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/blob/master/TODO.md#white-papers-project-08). We will focus on:
  1. Reviewing any proposed updates and revisions to 4 previously published papers
    + including [queries raised while implementing Central Tendency analyses](http://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/blob/master/TODO.md#wg5-principles-and-conventions)
  2. Discussing the 3 papers in active development

#### Standard Scripts

We have 2 main sources for standard scripts:
  1. Scripts from the FDA's JumpStart workflow
  2. Implementations of Standard Analyses from PhUSE CS White Papers, above

###### FDA JumpStart Scripts

We will present recent developments during CSS 2016. **If you want to get involved immediately** in reviewing and testing these scripts, please contact Hanming Tu (see the [PhUSE Wiki](http://www.phusewiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=Standard_Scripts) for email address).

###### Standard PhUSE CS Analyses (White Paper implementation)

There is still much to do to deliver the analyses in the White Paper on Central Tendency (**WPCT**). For full details, see our [WPCT Task List](http://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/blob/master/whitepapers/WPCT/TODO.md). From that list, we highlight a few specific tasks, to illustrate the range of ways that you can contribute your expertise. In increasing complexity:

  * Learn about the WPCT package from
    * [Our PhUSE wiki page](http://www.phusewiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=WG5_Project_02)
    * [Our GitHub WPCT User & Contributor Guide](http://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/blob/master/whitepapers/CentralTendency-UserGuide.md)
  * Test a Standard Script
    * R: Using our test data or your own ADaM data, produce Fig 7.1 and Fig 7.2 using the corresponding [R script](http://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/tree/master/whitepapers/WPCT)
    * SAS: Using our test data or your own ADaM data, produce Fig 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.6, 7.7 and 7.8 using the corresponding [SAS script](http://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/tree/master/whitepapers/WPCT)
    * **Give us feedback** on usability, documentation, design, etc. Help improve the approach and scripts.
  * Enhance a SAS or R script
    * Current R and SAS scripts are coded for 1 data domain, such as labs or vitals signs.
    * Analyse and document domain difference. ADaM expertise is highly valuable.
    * Propose an approach or mechanism for handling all intended domains: labs, vital signs, ECG.
  * Qualification criteria
    * Outline qualification requirements for each WPCT Figure. What should we test, to confirm the scripts work as expected? What would convince you that they are accurate and robust?
    * References: 
      * [White Paper on Central Tendency](http://www.phusewiki.org/wiki/images/4/48/CSS_WhitePaper_CentralTendency_v1.0.pdf)
      * [Specifications for the WPCT standard analyses](http://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/tree/master/whitepapers/specification), 
  * Test the [SAS macros behind the standard SAS scripts](http://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/wiki/Utility-Macro-Index-(SAS)).
    * That [SAS Macro Index page](http://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/wiki/Utility-Macro-Index-(SAS)) shows what has been done, and what remains.
    * Define and implement the tests for one of the remaining SAS macros
  * Test automation
    * Industry code should behave as expected for different users, in different environments
    * Design and propose a test-automation solution for the repository and code that we have
